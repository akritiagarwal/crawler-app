This applications find all the hyperlinks (absolute and relative ). Absolute hyperlinks are url which are in format 
"http://www.sampl-url.com", and relative url are of format "/nextpage/". Since this crawler is written to crawl a social website 
hence it contains plenty other hyperlinks apart from the domain on which we are crawling. The final output of the crawling is stored
in a .csv file which by defaults take stores the file in "/tmp" of system.
